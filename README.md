# Beat Saber AdaptiveSFXRemover

Disables automatic SFX volume adjustments.

You can enable/disable the mod in the mod settings.

## Notice regarding further mod development!
As of Beat Saber 1.12.1, the option provided by this mod is now part of the base game. You can switch off the adaptive sfx in the player settings (see screenshot below). Because of that, this mod won't get any more updates as long as it is part of the base game settings.
